After one night out we decided this just wouldn't do.

There's a mountain somewhere in those clouds.

I open the jars. She cooks whatever is in them.

I tried to end it here but she said we needed a mattress.

![](/images/{{page.slug}}/1435.jpg)
And then she said we needed somewhere to put things.

Now we're ready to go. Lights and a nightstand!

First night sleeping in the new bed. I only hit my head on the roof once.

Sadly one of these chairs jumped off the roof. I'll miss him/her.

Obligatory selfie in the home away from home.

One more star picture.

There's a river somewhere in there.

"Stand down by the river while I poop"

This guy had no clue we were taking pictures of him.

Don't worry, the e-brake is on.

The ladder rack says: "Max Weight 100 lbs." It lied. It supports way more than that.

People pay money for these kind of views.

This is why I don't brush my teeth.

Probably not the best spot to park your truck above.

![](/images/{{page.slug}}/0646.jpg)
She's gotten tired of me telling her to sit in the truck for a picture.

![](/images/{{page.slug}}/0652.jpg)
Or telling her to sit on an old crumbling house foundation for one.

![](/images/{{page.slug}}/0666.jpg)
But then we got oysters and she was happy again.

![](/images/{{page.slug}}/0694.jpg)
And went on this hike. She was even happier then.

In hindsight I should have stained or painted that rack...

![](/images/{{page.slug}}/0714.jpg)
Don't worry the truck was in park.

That's all folks.
