description: "Trek/Split started as a way to split up trip expenses between my friends and I. We use it religiously, from rafting to backpacking trips, it helps us split our expenses evenly. It has a Django backend, with extensive jQuery and AJAX to make the webapp seem as desktop-like as possible. It was designed &amp; developed by me in my spare time to solve a common problem."
