description: "Trek/Split started as a way to split up trip expenses between my friends and I. We use it religiously, from rafting to backpacking trips, it helps us split our expenses evenly. It has a Django backend primarily used as a REST server, with jQuery(Disclaimer: I built this in 2013) running the frontend."
