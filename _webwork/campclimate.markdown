description: "When searching for campgrounds throughout the United States I used to have multiple tabs open. One for USFS Campgrounds, one for State Campgrounds, and many to look at the weather for each of the campgrounds. It seemed like there should be somewhere that they all come together. Enter CampClimate, it is built with a Django backend, multiple census and campground databases, and connects to the NDFD Soap Server to retrieve weather info. It allows the user to now quickly search for campgrounds and weather in one place!"
